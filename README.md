  ## Installation Instructions 
  
  This application will require the use of a code editor like Visual Studio Code and node.js.  Once in the code editor type node server.js into the integrated terminal and then navigate to localhost:3001 in a browser.  AT that point you can sign-up and start blogging.

  ## Usage 
 
  On the website, there is a login link at the top left.  When you click that link you will have the opportunity to login  or sign up if you don't already have a username and password.  Once you are logged in, you will be taken to a page where you can create a new blog post.  If you click the home button, you will be able to view blog posts.  If  you click on a blog post, you will be taken to that post where you will have the opportunity to comment on it if you wish.  When you are ready to logout, head to the top right corner of the page and click the button.
